    <h1>PETA Takes Action Alongside <em>Blackfish</em></h1>
    
    <p>With the release of <em>Blackfish</em> and the help of PETA supporters, consumers are becoming more aware than ever that SeaWorld’s tanks are <strong>hellholes</strong> for animals.</p>

    <p>The documentary <em>Blackfish</em> has gained much popularity since its premiering at the Sundance Film Festival last January. It's a powerful film that focuses on Tilikum, the male orca who killed trainer Dawn Brancheau by pulling her into the water at SeaWorld Orlando in 2010. Throughout the film, <em>Blackfish</em> focuses on interviews with several former SeaWorld trainers as well as one of SeaWorld's former whale hunters.</p>
    
    <p>The documentary exposes the terrible conditions in which these animals are living and the poor training methods that continue to be utilized. PETA has joined in the fight against SeaWorld and its sister parks and urges consumers to reconsider their family vacation destinations.  Their photo below demonstrates one of the many cruelties seen at the <em>abuse</em>ment park. Pictured is Tilikum, who is forced to remain in a small enclosure; it’s clear that it is way too small as the animal’s head and tail nearly touch either side of the enclosure.</p>

    <p>Orcas in captivity are only provided with the bare minimum of space for swimming. Not nearly enough for them to live a long and healthy life. Wild orcas live on average about 50 years but have been known to reach 80-100 years, sadly the expected lifespan in captivity is a mere 9 years. </p>
    <p>In the wild, whales normally swim up to 100 miles a day. The tanks at SeaWorld however are the equivalent size of a bathtub. An orca at SeaWorld would have to swim the circumference of the main pool 1,900 times in one day to swim the same distance.</p>
